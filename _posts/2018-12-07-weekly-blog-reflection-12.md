# My Flag
 - Today, I am tryig to create the American Flag. So, I need the geomerty of the flag, and I got this image online.  
 ![American Flag Geometry](/img/flag/AmericanFlagGeomerty.gif)
 - This image shows the length of the flag is 1.9 times the width of the flag, meaning I can make it scalabe my just changing the width, like,
 ```scheme
 	(define width 100)
  	(define length (* width 1.9))
 ```
