We took the ***Fall 2018 Lower Academy Computer Science Midterm Exam***.  
The hardest question for me was *#20*.  
It showed the,
```scheme
(* 100 (/ 1 6))
(* 150 (/ 1 6))
(* 90 (/ 1 6))
```
and the question what was the changing part, or the abtract part.  
I didn't know what it ment by *the abtract part of the expression*, or what is *the changing variable*.
