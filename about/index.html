	<h1>About Me</h1>
	<p>I started coding when I was 10 years old. One day, I was talking with my friend, Willie, and we were just talking about games, like the new releases, and games that we played and liked. And I just brought up, "Hey, wouldn't it be cool if we could make our <i>own</i> games?". And he said yea. So, I started researching how to make games. And this was when I knew <b>nothing</b> about code, and what it was, but was passionate to find out... I found all these game engines, and they all looked <i>so</i> complicated. But, I ended up using this 2D game engine that only has physics like the <i>Super Mario Bros.</i> game. </p>
